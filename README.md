## Drivers Information

_The drivers are ordered based on the recommended level._

### MHR - 漫畫人 / 漫畫社

This driver fetches the manga information from the reverse-engineered mobile API server. Its source is the same as `DM5` but faster in responding.

### MHG - 漫畫櫃

This driver scraped the manga information from the website. It is slow and extremely unstable due to its strict request limit. However, it has the most up-to-date manga.
